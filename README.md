# StrSplit


This repository is a very basic implementation of `StrSplit`. Idea is to understand the use of lifetimes in rust and how to navigate through it. There are very few times in Rust where you may need multiple lifetimes. This is one of those cases. I have also explored on how use generics so that we can avoid unecessary allocation.
